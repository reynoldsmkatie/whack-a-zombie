### Description:
On October 28, 2021, I challenged myself to build a spooky 10-second game in 3 daysâ€”just in time for a Halloween release. Despite 2 of those 3 days being work days, I was able to code in the evenings and on a Saturday in order to get a functional (and fun!) game ready to play by Sunday the 31st.

I built this game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Though it's templated off my previous games, I learned several new concepts about nested CSS Grids, callback functions and other properties I hadn't used before.

### Game Synopsis:
Whack-a-Zombie is a creepy take on the classic whack-a-mole game. The zombies are taking over! You have 10 seconds to kill as many as possible before they leave their graves and take over the town.
